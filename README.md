# EatingGoals
A projected created for Delta Hacks 3 to create a platform that allows medical institutes to input client data on medical conditions and optimize a necessary diet to combat the condition and clients would upload the food they intake and would have the opportunity to take a look at the nutritional values of their diet and compare it to the recommended one. This app aims to maintain a close relationship between a medical institute and clients so that daily progress can be monitered by the institute and the user would have a clean and easily manageable UI to navigate through and input required data.
